## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- **Keep dependencies up to date**
- **Use environment variables for secrets** - Do not commit secrets. Use .env locally and secret stores in production
- **Implement proper authentication and authorization**
- **Validate and sanitize all user inputs**
- **Use HTTPS in production**
- **Regular security audits and code reviews**
- **Rotate credentials on role changes**

### For Deployments

- **Use strong passwords and 2FA**
- **Keep the platform updated**
- **Configure firewalls and network security**
- **Regular backups and disaster recovery plans**
- **Monitor for suspicious activities**
- **Use secure configurations**
