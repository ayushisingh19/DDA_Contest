Contributing Guide

- Use Conventional Commits (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, build, ci).
- Create feature branches; open PRs with a concise description and checklist.
- Add or update tests with code changes.
- Keep functions small, typed, and documented.
- Respect code owners/reviewers when defined.
